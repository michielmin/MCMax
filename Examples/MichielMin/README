These are two example input models and two example observation files:

inputDIANA.dat:	This file is the DIANA standard disk. It is a parameterized disk structure
	with DIANA standard opacities and PAHs.

inputITER.dat:	This is an model with a vertical structure in hydrostatic equilibrium.
	It does not have PAHs. Opacities are also DIANA standard.
	
Spectrum.out:	This file can be used to generate a raytraced SED. Please take care that
	the Nphot keywords are high enough to avoid noise.
	
Image.out:		This file created two images, one in full res and one convolved with the
	PSF of the VLT with a seeing of 0.1''. Also here it is important to have the Nphot
	keywords sufficiently high.
	
The following command runs MCMax with the Iterated example, puts it in the directory ITER,
and created the SED and Images:

MCMax inputITER.dat 100000 -o ITER Image.out Spectrum.out
