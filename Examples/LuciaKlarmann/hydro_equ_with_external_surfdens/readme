hydrostatic equilibrium model with gap, using external input from Til Birnstiel's full disk code (tunnel and traffic jam model) for the dust composition and surface density. Also the opacities are not calculated with MCMax, but provided from file (MakeMix). The gas is included as a gas particle, and the gas opacities are set to 0 using an opacity file for that particle.

 
Run just the RT model with:
my1_mjup5> MCMax my1_mjup5.in 5e5 -o Output 
 
Run the model, + spectrum and normal resolution images
my1_mjup5> MCMax my1_mjup5.in 5e5 -o Output Spectrum.out Image.out

Only the observations, when the RT model is already there
my1_mjup5> MCMax 1e5 my1_mjup5.in 0 -o Output  Spectrum.out Image.out

The RT for these modesl are resonably fast. The image calculation takes long, especially in HR

The image files demonstrate how images at multiple wavelength can all be created using one .out file
