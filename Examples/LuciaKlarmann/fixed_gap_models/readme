fixed disk model (no hydrostatic equilibrium), with standard DIANA dust, and a gap where the dust is reduced by 90%. The setup of the Particles files can be find on the opacity tool page of the DIANA hompage.

the RT calculation is done on one core, part of the observations are done with multiple cores. For large grids, it can be usefule to split the calculations into all RT calculations first, running #cores simulations in paralles. Then the observatons (images, spectra, interferometry) are calculated afterwards, one by one.
 
Run just the RT model with:
large_10ingap> MCMax large_10ingap.in 5e5 -o Output 
 
Run the model, + Interferometric observation with the UTs in the H band and N band
large_10ingap> MCMax large_10ingap.in 5e5 -o Output Interferometry_gaps_H_-60_45_UT Interferometry_gaps_N_-60_45_UT

Only the observations, when the RT model is already there
large_10ingap> MCMax 1e5 large_10ingap.in 0 -o Output  Interferometry_gaps_H_-60_45_UT Interferometry_gaps_N_-60_45_UT

The RT for these modesl is very fast. Calculating the interferometric observation will take longer

Each observation files calculates the visibility and phase against wavelength (VISIBILITY file)
This is done for a set of baselines, taken directly from the Paranal setup, for a target at -60 dec, using a 15 min sampling ('optimal uv coverage')
The UT files include all UT baselines
The other files all AT baselines (small, medium, large, astrometric)
The letter indicates the band
For each band, 6 wavlength are sampled, but 15 for the N band (low resolution)
The Interferometry_gaps.out file provides a quick overview of the K- and N-band interferometry results (BASEVIS)
