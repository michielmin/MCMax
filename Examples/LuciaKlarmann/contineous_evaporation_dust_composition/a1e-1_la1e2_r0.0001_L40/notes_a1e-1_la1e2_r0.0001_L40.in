**** general setup ****
startype='KURUCZ' 
Tstar=10000
Mstar=2.5
Lstar=47.0


Distance=114 !in pc, will be used for all observations if not set differently in the observation file

**** density setup ****

denstype='DOUBLEPOW' !flat surface density out to 4 au, then a power law index of 1.5
denspow=0.00
denspow2=1.5
Rpow2=4.0

Mdust=3.2d-4 !total initial disk mass
Rin=0.03 !initial inner radius, better to choose smaller than expected inner radius
Rout=200 
Nrad=700 ! radial grid points, 
Ntheta=90 ! angle grid points
** do not go lower for evaporation/condensation models, or for models that will be used to generate interferometric or other very high resolution observations **
** if the model segfaults, the heap space of the computer is probably too small for the gridcells. On linux -> ulimit -s unlimited **
**** grid refinement ****

Nspan=40
Nlev=15

**** wavelength grid ****

lam1=0.1
lam2=5000
nlam=300

**** opacities ****


** here, the internal size distribution calculation is used for one grain. That is not necessary, but leads to the creation of an mrn file, useful for automatic labelling **
