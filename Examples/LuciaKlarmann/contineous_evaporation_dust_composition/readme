sample setup

the subgroup folder contineous_evaporation_dust_composition is the only subfolder
it contains the models  a1e-1_la1e2_r0.0001_L40 and f_1e0_r0.01_L8
each model has all necessaray files to run MCMax inside
the MCMax output is in the Output folder inside the model folder
in the output folder, there is a plot folder collecting all plots for this model
in the subfolder, there is a common plots folder, collecting the plots for all models

The .run file can be used as a shell script to start the RT
The .ray folder can be used as a shell script to start the observations

they are created with write_simestart_files2.py

You can also use them as input for another bash script, running many RT models at the same time, since they only use 1 core

You can run subgroup_multiplot_CD.py to create a standard set of plots for each model
